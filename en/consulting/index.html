        I work with managers who want to do things differently.
        Whether it's building a clear strategy, taking a hard look at the management culture that grew organically and changing it, or navigating periods of change or burnout – I'm here because it's always easier together.

      <h2>How We Can Work Together</h2>

      <div class="service-item">
        <h3>Manager Coaching (1:1)</h3>
        <p>
          A space to create clarity and have someone in your corner. Especially suited for transitions: stepping into a first or senior role, managing a complex project, or thinking about what's next.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal isn't just solving the current problem, but developing a quiet, steady managerial confidence. Together we'll break down the noise into an action plan, and reconnect effective how with your professional and personal why.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="service-item">
        <h3>Strategy, For Real – Organizational Work</h3>
        <p>
          I come into organizations to understand what's really stuck, and build a work plan that people actually want to execute.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through analysis and collaborative problem-solving, we engage the team through meaning, smart internal communication, and serious, efficient follow-through that holds the healthy tension of getting things done.
        </p>

        <h3>Time & Task Management: Workshops and Team Coaching</h3>
        <p>
          They call it "time management," but there's no such thing – in practice we learn to manage attention, energy, and availability. It's far less mumbo jumbo than you've been told.
        </p>
        <p>
          The real change happens when working as a team or organic group: when we create shared language around calendars, redefine what's urgent, learn to run effective meetings, and create protected spaces for Deep Work that delivers results.
        </p>
        <p>
          Available as a team workshop, a one-time talk, or personal coaching for managers who want to take back control of their calendar.

      <h2>Stress-Free Time Management</h2>
      <p>
        Time management is a vital skill in modern life. We all juggle multiple roles, commitments, dreams, and tasks in just 24 hours a day. In this workshop we learn accepted approaches to time management and gain tools to find the method that works for us. We remember that time passes whether we manage it or not, and discover ways to manage ourselves and our environment to get more done – calmly.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll build a personalized system that reflects our priorities, learn to prioritize tasks, carve out quality time free of distractions, and develop habits for efficient, relaxed organization within the unique situations of each person's life.
      </p>

      <h3>What we do in the workshop</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Break myths about time management</li>
        <li>Build a personal self-management system that actually works</li>
        <li>Learn to prioritize and define availability and urgency</li>
        <li>Learn to lift our head from the urgent and execute what's important</li>
      </ul>
