      <h1>Organizations</h1>

        I work with managers who want to do things differently.
        Whether it's building a clear strategy, taking a hard look at the management culture that grew organically and changing it, or navigating periods of change or burnout – I'm here because it's always easier together.

      <h2>How I Work</h2>

      <div class="service-item">
        <h3>Order from Chaos</h3>
        <p>
          I meet with managers who have a tangle of thoughts in their head, and help them leave the meeting with everything clean, organized, and ready for action.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="service-item">
        <h3>A Plan People Want to Execute</h3>
        <p>
          I come into organizations to understand what's stuck, and together we build a plan to do things differently – one that doesn't just look good on paper, but one that people actually want to execute.
        </p>

      <div class="service-item">
        <h3>Time Management, Life Management</h3>
        <p>
          I teach time management, but really I teach life management.
          I believe in combining the practical with the personal. Not "either-or".
          I look at things with a kind eye, but also a very sharp one.
        </p>

      <h2>Who It's For</h2>
      <p>
        Managers who want to do more – better, easier, more enjoyably.
        No pomposity, no inflated words – just making things work better, and bringing the spark back to the doing.
      </p>

      <h2>Stress-Free Time Management</h2>
      <p>
        Time management is a vital skill in modern life. We all juggle multiple roles, commitments, dreams, and tasks in just 24 hours a day. In this workshop we learn accepted approaches to time management and gain tools to find the method that works for us. We remember that time passes whether we manage it or not, and discover ways to manage ourselves and our environment to get more done – calmly.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll build a personalized system that reflects our priorities, learn to prioritize tasks, carve out quality time free of distractions, and develop habits for efficient, relaxed organization within the unique situations of each person's life.
      </p>

      <h3>What we do in the workshop</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Break myths about time management</li>
        <li>Build a personal self-management system that actually works</li>
        <li>Learn to prioritize and define availability and urgency</li>
        <li>Learn to lift our head from the urgent and execute what's important</li>
      </ul>
