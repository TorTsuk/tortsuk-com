      <h1>Organizations</h1>
      <p class="tagline">
        I work with managers who want to do things differently.
        Whether it's building a clear strategy, taking an honest look at the management culture that grew on its own and changing it, or navigating change and burnout – I'm here because it's always easier together.

      <h2>How We Can Work Together</h2>

      <div class="service-item">
        <h3>Manager Coaching (1:1)</h3>
        <p>
          A space to get clarity and have someone in your corner. Especially good for transitions: stepping into a first management role or a senior one, leading a complex project, or figuring out what's next.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal isn't just to solve the current problem – it's to build a quiet, steady confidence as a manager. Together we'll cut through the noise, build an action plan, and reconnect the effective how with your professional and personal why.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="service-item">
        <h3>Strategy, For Real – Organizational Work</h3>
        <p>
          I come into organizations to understand what's really stuck, and build a work plan that people actually want to execute.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through analysis and working through problems together, we get the team on board with meaning, smart internal communication, and serious follow-through that keeps the healthy tension of actually getting things done.
        </p>

        <h3>Time & Task Management: Workshops and Team Coaching</h3>
        <p>
          They call it "time management," but there's no such thing – in practice we learn to manage attention, energy, and availability. It's far less mumbo jumbo than you've been told.
        </p>
        <p>
          The real change happens when you work as a team: creating shared language about calendars, redefining what's actually urgent, running meetings that work, and protecting space for Deep Work that delivers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Available as a team workshop, a one-time talk, or personal coaching for managers who want to take back control of their calendar.

      <h2>Stress-Free Time Management</h2>
      <p>
        Time management is a life skill. We all juggle roles, commitments, dreams, and tasks – all in 24 hours. In this workshop we learn practical approaches and get tools to find what actually works for us. Time passes whether we manage it or not – so we learn to manage ourselves and our environment, and get more done, calmly.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll build a system that fits your priorities, learn to prioritize, carve out distraction-free time, and develop habits for calm, efficient organization – adapted to each person's actual life.
      </p>

      <h3>What we do in the workshop</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Break myths about time management</li>
        <li>Build a personal self-management system that actually works</li>
        <li>Learn to prioritize and define availability and urgency</li>
        <li>Learn to lift our head from the urgent and execute what's important</li>
      </ul>
