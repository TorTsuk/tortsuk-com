        Hi, I'm Tor.
      </p>
      <p>
        People, processes, and stories – that's what I'm about. I work with managers and organizations who get that you go further together.
        I also have a day job as a product manager at a big tech company, a podcast called <a href="/en/podcast/">Weekly Sync</a>, and I'm a single mom to Neri, so yes – I also run time management workshops.

      <h2>What I Actually Do</h2>
      <p>
        I sit with managers who have a mess of thoughts in their head, and help them walk out with everything clear, sorted, and ready for action.
      </p>
      <p>
        I come into organizations to understand what's stuck, and together we build a plan to do things differently – one that doesn't just look good on paper, but one that people actually want to execute.
      </p>

      <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
      <p>
        I believe the best things happen when you mix the practical and no-nonsense with empathy and heart. No need for either-or.
      </p>
      <p>
        I bring a kind eye, but also a very sharp one.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe in growth that starts from the foundation: knowing your strengths and building around them. And in always learning. Working together, we do both – strengthen your natural anchors while staying curious and building new ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm here to help you do more – better, easier, and with more joy.
        No pomposity, no big words – just making things work, and making work feel good again.
      </p>
