        Hi, I'm Tor.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I love most is people, processes, and stories. I work with managers and organizations who understand that you go further together.
        I also have a day job as a product manager at a large tech company, a podcast called <a href="/en/podcast/">Weekly Sync</a>, and I'm a single mom to Neri, so yes, I also run time management workshops.

      <h2>What I Actually Do</h2>
      <p>
        I meet with managers who have a tangle of thoughts in their head, and help them leave the meeting with everything clean, organized, and ready for action.
      </p>
      <p>
        I come into organizations to understand what's stuck, and together we build a plan to do things differently – one that doesn't just look good on paper, but one that people actually want to execute.
      </p>

      <h2>What Guides Me</h2>
      <p>
        I believe in combining the practical with the personal. Not "either-or".
        <br>I teach time management, but really I teach life management.
        <br>I look at things with a kind eye, but also a very sharp one.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm here to help you do more – better, easier, more enjoyably.
        No pomposity, no inflated words – just making things work better, and bringing the spark back to the doing.
      </p>
